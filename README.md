# Computational Photography Algorithms

I implemented some filters I've learned in class CSED551-01. All of them are written in Python.    
\* DL means deep learning.  

A. Sharpening  
  - Rule-based:    
    - Unsharp masking with Spatial Filter (Conv)  
    - Unsharp masking with Frequency Filter (FFT)
  
B. Denoising  
  - Rule-based:  
    - Bilateral Filter  
    - Guidance Filter  
    
C. Edge Detection  
  - Rule-based:  
    - Canny Edge Detector  
    - Harris-Corner Detector  
    - Sobel Filter  
  
D. Special Effect  
  - Rule-based:  
    - [Splash of Colour](https://github.com/koominsoo/Splash_of_Colour/blob/master/README.md)  
  
E. Colour Space Conversion  
  - RGB -> YCbCr  


F. Image Blending

  - Rule-based:
    - Laplacian Pyramid
