# Computational Photography Algorithms

I implemented some filters I've learned in class CSED551-01. All of them are written in Python.  
\* DL means deep learning.  

A. Sharpening  
  
  Rule-based:  
    1. Unsharp
    2. Unsharp  
  
B. Denoising

  Rule-based:
    1. Bilateral Filter
    2. Guidance Filter
  
C. Edge Detection

  Rule-based:
    1. Canny Edge Detector
    2. Harris-Corner Detector
    3. Sobel Filter
  
D. Special Effect

  Rule-based:
    1. Splash of Colour
  
E. Colour Space Conversion
  1. RGB -> YCbCr


F. Image Blending

  Rule-based:
    1. Laplacian Pyramid
