# Computational Photography Algorithms

I implemented some filters I've learned in class CSED551-01. All of them are written in Python.    
\* DL means deep learning.  

A. Sharpening  
  - Unsharp masking with Spatial Filter (Conv)  
  - Unsharp masking with Frequency Filter (FFT)
  
B. Denoising   
  - Bilateral Filter  
  - Guidance Filter  
    
C. Edge Detection  
  - Canny Edge Detector  
  - Harris-Corner Detector  
  - Sobel Filter  
  
D. Special Effect  
  - [Splash of Colour](https://github.com/koominsoo/Splash_of_Colour/blob/master/README.md)  
  
E. Colour Space Conversion  
  - [Manual RGB -> YCbCr](https://github.com/koominsoo/RGB2YCbCr) 

F. Image Blending
  - Laplacian Pyramid

G. Overlapping Estimation
  - 2D RANSAC
